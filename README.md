<h3>I used to face a lot of problem while tranferring filer and then emailing them. So, I did what a developer does :D.</h3>
<h4>The web-app is built upon Next.js and the styling is done using Tailwind CSS. It was my first time working with these and needless to say, I enjoyed playing around with them.</h4>
